## Usage

1. Open the web application in your browser through this [link](https://dgee02.github.io/OMDb-search/).

2. Enter any portion for the title of a movie, series, episode, etc. into the main search bar. Due to the limits of the OMDb API, at least 3 characters are required for any search to work.

3. Use additional filters to refine your search, if desired. Keep in mind when inputting more than one value into a filter, each value must be separated with a single comma and no spaces in between (e.g., value1,value2,value3). 

4. Click the search button or press Enter on your keyboard to view search results.

5. Click on any result to explore additional information about it including runtime, trailer, plot summary, ratings, and more.
